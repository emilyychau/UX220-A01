&ensp; Overall, the outcomes for students who perform goal setting activities are positive and pose benefits to their ability to engage in self-regulated learning (Chang et al., 2018). This would be pertinent to my goals of attending further education after completing my degree here at Laurier. The COVID-19 pandemic made virtual and/or asynchronous class delivery much more common throughout all levels of education. In such instances, of which I have already encountered, one’s ability to self-regulate in their learning would be very applicable to instances where courses are asynchronous or where there are generally fewer accountability touch points for students–as is typical in these settings of higher education.

&ensp; The 2018 paper also finds that “learners with better learning goal setting have the belief to accomplish learning goals, and agree with the value of [those] subjects. Thus, their learning motivation is stronger” (Chang et al., 2018). Agree with it as I find–anecdotally–that my motivation is positively affected by goal setting. I feel more motivated when I commit those goals to writing, compared to if they were simply acknowledged as to-do task items. The benefits identified in one Georgian state university were vast; when e-learning portfolios were trialled, it presented benefits to students’ academic achievement, connection to the curricula, and their own career prospects (Cleveland, 2018).

&ensp; It is not all beneficial however, Chang et al’s study does mention that “those who are better at goal setting have worse defensive self-reaction[s]” (2018). Meaning that the likelihood of avoidant or abandonment type behaviours are increased because of personal expectations and a fear of worsened performance in the future. <!-- edits here -->

&ensp; The strengths and benefits of portfolio building and goal setting are evident in the two sources mentioned, but also in other pieces of literature on the topic of student goal setting and reflection. A gap in the literature exists however, whereby other types of benefits or drawbacks - such as the impact of goal setting activities or other reflexive exercises have on the different dimensions of an individual’s wellness (physical, mental, social).
